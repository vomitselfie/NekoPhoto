# Compositor project format, versions 1–6

A `.comp` file is a macOS document package containing `manifest.json` and an `images/` directory of `<layer UUID>.png` assets.

The manifest identifies `com.compositor.project`, version `6` for new saves (versions `1`–`5` remain readable), and the sRGB working space. It stores document UUID, pixel dimensions, active layer UUID, and layers in bottom-to-top order. Each layer stores its UUID, name, visibility, transform (origin, size, clockwise rotation, flips, sampling), and optional image filename. Blank layers have no image asset.

Embedded PNGs preserve source pixels and transparency; transforms remain separate. Projects survive moving or deleting imported source photos. Saving uses a coordinated atomic package replacement. Unsupported versions, invalid metadata, missing assets, unsafe paths, and oversized data are rejected before replacing the live document.

Limits: 30,000 pixels per canvas/image side, 100 million total source pixels, 10,000 layers, 4 MiB manifest, 512 MiB per encoded asset. See `ProjectStore.swift` for validation.

Undo history and viewport are session-only. Opening fits the canvas, restores selection, and starts with clean history. Future editable features must extend the schema and round-trip tests. PNG export is a flattened derivative and does not mark project edits saved.

Image Size adds optional `resolution` (pixels/inch, 1–9600). Older manifests without it default to 72. This additive field retains version 1 compatibility. Both PNG and JPEG exports include document resolution metadata. Resampling stores the new layer pixels and bounds; undo retains the prior sources only during the current session.

Version 2 adds optional `parentID` and `isGroup` on layer records. A group has no image file. Root nodes have no parent; children refer to an existing group. Array order defines bottom-to-top sibling order; renderers traverse each group as a contiguous subtree. Visibility is inherited without changing child flags. Cycles, missing/non-group parents, image-bearing groups, and nesting beyond 64 ancestor levels are rejected. Group ancestors permit room for leaf nodes at the deepest level. Group metadata survives image/canvas resizing and cropping. Older app builds reject version 2 rather than misrender grouped documents. Collapse state is not serialized.

Version 3 adds optional per-layer `opacity` (finite 0–1) and `blendMode` (Normal, Multiply, Screen, Overlay, Darken, Lighten, Difference, Color Dodge, Color Burn). Missing fields default to full opacity and Normal. Group records currently require those defaults; their children can have independent effects. Effects are applied during compositing and retained as metadata when resizing sources. Files declaring older versions cannot contain non-default appearance values.

Version 4 adds optional `maskFile` and `maskEnabled` fields to individual layers. Mask filenames must be `<layer UUID>.mask.png` under `images/`; enabled defaults to true when a mask exists. Records without masks omit both fields. Groups cannot carry masks in this version. Files declaring versions 1–3 cannot contain mask metadata.

Masks store 8-bit grayscale coverage without alpha (white reveals, black hides). Their normalized extent matches the image’s local rectangle, so the same layer transform applies to both. A uniform 1×1 mask is valid and avoids allocating full-resolution pixels before painting. Nonuniform mask pixels and a thumbnail are immutable assets shared by history. Image Size resamples them with the image transform; Canvas Size and Crop preserve their pixels. Up to 100 million mask pixels may be stored in addition to the existing 100 million image pixels; per-side and per-file limits also apply to masks. Disabled masks remain embedded and editable but do not affect compositing. Image-versus-mask target selection is session-only and reopens on image pixels.

Version 5 adds optional `maskSourceID`: the UUID of a non-group layer supplying live alpha in document coordinates. It multiplies the target’s alpha alongside its enabled raster mask. Source pixels, transform, opacity, raster mask and upstream live masks contribute coverage; visibility and RGB color do not. Sources remain independent layers. Missing references, self-links, cycles, group endpoints and chains over 256 nodes are rejected. Deletion can bake the live coverage into dependent image pixels (retaining their raster masks) or remove the links, as one undoable operation. Links survive image/canvas resize and crop. Older versions default to no live mask; older app builds reject v5.

UI terminology: these alpha links are clipping masks. Option-click assigns the lower sibling’s base or releases the connection. Multiple clipped layers share one base, show indented above it, and release when moved outside the contiguous stack. The underlying `maskSourceID` representation is unchanged.

Version 6 allows `maskFile` and `maskEnabled` on group records. A folder has no image, so its mask covers the folder's own transform rectangle (the canvas size when the folder was created); Image Size resamples it through that transform, and Canvas Size and Crop preserve its pixels, exactly as for layer masks. Groups are pass-through, so an enabled folder mask multiplies the coverage of every descendant layer, together with that layer's own mask and any enclosing folders' masks; clipping-mask coverage is unaffected. Files declaring versions 1–5 cannot give a group a mask, and older app builds reject v6.

Version 8 (NekoPhoto) gives folders their own `opacity` and `blendMode`, and `passThrough` (default `true`):
a pass-through folder's children blend straight into what is below it and its opacity fades their result back
toward that backdrop; `passThrough: false` isolates the children and composites the folder's result in its
blend mode and opacity, as Photoshop does. A save writes version 7 whenever no folder uses these, so the Mac app
(which reads up to 7) still opens it; version 7 files cannot give a folder non-default values.
